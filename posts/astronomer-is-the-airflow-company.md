Today is Astronomer’s third birthday. We have a lot to celebrate, and an exciting announcement. But first, let's set the stage on how we got here.

* Astronomer was founded back in 2015 as a clickstream data routing tool, initially for [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) Javascript apps (which is the origin of our space-related name in case you never knew that). 
* In 2016 we launched [Aries Data](https://github.com/aries-data) — a data pipeline workflow library in Javascript. Big data people thought we were weird (we were), and we subsequently shut that effort down in favor of Python and Airflow.
* In 2017 we launched a [hosted Airflow service](https://www.astronomer.io/airflow/).
* And now in 2018 we’ve launched [Astronomer Enterprise Edition](https://www.astronomer.io/enterprise/), Airflow on Kubernetes.

We're proud of the work we've done and the company and products we've built, and business has never been better.

However, running multiple products is tough. Nobody does their best work when they're spread too thin. While we could hire a bunch more people to do a bunch more things… we believe multi-directional, rapid expansion is very difficult (if not impossible) to do great.

With that in mind, we recently conducted a thorough review of our products, our customer base, our passions, and our vision for the company. When we put it all on the table, everything lined up and pointed at one clear conclusion. The whole team was excited. We knew it was right.

So today, May 21, 2018, exactly three years to the day since we launched Astronomer, we have a big announcement to make: **Astronomer is now "The Airflow Company"**.

Moving forward, we will focus on doing just one thing: helping organizations adopt Apache Airflow. Our entire company will rally around this objective. With our whole team — from design to engineering to customer success to ops — focused on one thing, we will get better in every direction, and on every dimension.

With this change, we renew our commitment to all things Airflow: 

* We’re getting way more involved in the official [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) open-source project.
* [Enterprise Edition](https://enterprise.astronomer.io/) is evolving quickly, we'll soon introduce multi-user teams and the ability to quickly deploy/teardown airflow clusters on any cloud.
* We’ll produce [Airflow Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/the-airflow-podcast) episodes more regularly.
* We’ll build and curate more [Airflow Plugins](https://github.com/airflow-plugins).
* We’ll write [Airflow Guides](https://github.com/astronomerio/airflow_guides) that make it dead simple to build standard pipelines in Airflow.
* We’re scaling up [Spacecamp](https://www.astronomer.io/blog/announcing-astronomer-spacecamp/), our Airflow training program, to make it more accessible.
* We’re expanding our Airflow data engineering team that can be borrowed for short bursts, to add horsepower to you data engineering team.

All in on Airflow, all things Airflow.

Each one of us will be dedicated to making it easier to adopt Airflow, extending Airflow’s reach, expanding Airflow’s capabilities, and making sure our customers are treated like royalty.

And we'll never forget what made Airflow so popular in the first place: It just works. It's simple, it's easy to use, it's easy to understand, it's clear, it's reliable, and it's dependable. We'll continue to make it more of all of those things.

The last three years have been a blast, but with every future moment focused on Airflow, the next three years are going to be even better. We're fired up!

Please visit [our updated site](https://www.astronomer.io) and have a look around. If you're not an Astronomer customer yet, give us a try. We'd love to have you. If you already are, we thank you for your business.

Thank you from all of us at Astronomer.

**Questions & answers**

Q: What’s so awesome about Apache Airflow?

With the rise of data science teams and ML/AI, orchestrating data pipelines is on a sharp rise, and will continue to be critical to extract value from data. Data scientists and engineers want to collaborate in an agile manner, but Airflow elegantly bridges the gap. Python is the right language, Airflow provides the right amount of structure. Data engineering is THE critical missing link to unlock the value from the big investments that have been made in data lakes, data warehouses, and data science teams. This is a huge, rapidly developing market that Airflow and Astronomer can win.

Q: If you're going all in on Airflow, what happens to Clickstream?

As one of our valued Clickstream customers, nothing will change for you over the short term. Business as usual. No interruption or change to the service. Over the the medium term, we'll develop a more permanent solution, and that could take a variety of forms. But rest assured, we will continue to take care of you.
