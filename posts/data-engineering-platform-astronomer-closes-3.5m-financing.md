_The Astronomer platform collects, processes and unifies data, allowing organizations to scale analytics, data science and insights._

(Cincinnati, OH—JUNE 28, 2017) &nbsp;Astronomer, a data engineering platform, closed $3.5M in new financing, led by Wireframe Ventures in San Francisco and CincyTech in Cincinnati. Other investors include Frontline Ventures (UK), Grand Ventures, Drummond Road, Core Network, M25 Group, with debt financing participation from Silicon Valley Bank.

For high-growth startups to Fortune 500 enterprises, data analytics has become a critical requirement for winning in today’s business environment. However, most companies struggle to build this capability, due to the complexity of accessing, organizing and managing large amounts of data. According to Forbes, even data science teams spend up to 80% of their time simply preparing data before it’s ready for high-value business analysis.

Astronomer’s data engineering platform automates this heavy lifting through the release of a library of reusable connectors and pipelines “recipes” that seamlessly collect and route data from any source, like Salesforce or Google Analytics, to any destination, like Redshift or MySQL, in an enterprise. The result is dramatically less time wasted on data preparation and routing and spent, instead, on extracting valuable business insight from their data and realizing untapped revenue potential.

“Data engineering, which includes accessing and preparing data for analysis, takes up the vast majority of a business analyst’s time. We constantly hear the same complaint—not only is this incredibly inefficient, but the opportunity cost is tremendous. If organizations implement a focused, iterative data engineering effort, they’d free up their people to extract insights that impact the bottom line,” said Ry Walker, Co-founder and CEO of Astronomer.

“Despite major advancements in big data technology platforms over the last decade, data engineering continues to be a manual and highly labor-intensive barrier to wider adoption. Astronomer’s platform can greatly streamline this complex upfront work, enabling a much wider set of enterprises to fully leverage the power of data science to help drive business performance,” said Harsh Patel, Managing Partner of Wireframe Ventures.

Astronomer plans to use this financing to grow its product and engineering teams and expand sales efforts. Astronomer customers include P&G, Everything But The House (EBTH) and Roadtrippers, along with many other enterprise, mid-market and startup organizations.
