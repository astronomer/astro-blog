The [internationally-renowned data analytics unconference](https://measurecamp.org/), MeasureCamp, is coming to Cincinnati on May 13, 2017!&nbsp;

MeasureCamp is a free event run by the digital analytics community, for the digital analytics community. The “unconference” format has no scheduled presentations. Instead, attendees exchange ideas and ask each other to create “sessions” on the spot, whether it’s leading a technical conversation or a creative brainstorm. Anyone who wants to join the analytics conversation is welcome to attend.

“I’m absolutely thrilled that MeasureCamp is coming to the US,” said Peter O’Neil, founder of the conference. “Since 2012, MeasureCamp has developed a cult-like following across Europe and beyond in cities like London, Barcelona and Amsterdam, each with their own growing data analytics communities, and Cincinnati is no different.”

Dave Paprocki, Director of Marketing at Astronomer and MeasureCamp Cincinnati organizer says, “It solidifies Cincinnati’s reputation internationally as a hub for data and analytics enthusiasts, especially considering the first two cities in the US to host the event are Cincinnati and San Francisco. We not only wanted sponsor it, we wanted to be on the ground floor and help to organize it.”

"Tapping into our collective experience as a community is key to solving our personal and corporate missions in digital analytics,” said Hananiel Sarella, Lead Developer at Kroger and MeasureCamp Cincinnati organizer. “I am thrilled with the excitement and support we have received in organizing this event."

The day-long event begins at 9 a.m. on Saturday, May 13, 2017, at Union Hall 1311 Vine St, Cincinnati, OH, 45202. Thanks to sponsorships from Astronomer, Brooksource, CBTS, InfoTrust, Rocklogic, Callibrity and Rhinegeist, registration is free and refreshments and lunch are provided. A networking happy hour immediately follows.

Limited to 150 attendees, early bird tickets are already sold out. The next release of tickets will be available online Wednesday, Feb. 15, at 9 a.m. EST at [cincinnati.measurecamp.org](https://cincinnati.measurecamp.org/). The second US MeasureCamp will be held in San Francisco in June 2017.
