Out in the field, I connect with prospects and customers from a variety of backgrounds with broad-ranging products and experiences. Not only do I thrive on these conversations, but I also view them as a key way to learn about how their products work and where third-party services provide greatest value to their customers.

With that said, people are often hesitant to ask me what they may consider basic questions. For example, many feel they "should" already know how Google Analytics can track user data, or what other tools can compliment the data that Google Analytics provides.  
  
The fact is, there are no bad questions! I understand these questions may seem basic, but technology is changing fast, especially when it comes to marketing data and user analytics. In this video-edition of 'Ask RBK,' I chat with Viraj Parekh, Astronomer's Data Analyst, to answer some of the most common questions I get about Google Analytics.

Feel free to ask your questions about Google Analytics in the comments section below.
