The demand for custom data pipelines is on a sharp rise, and better tools need to exist to allow software engineers to create data pipelines without having to worry about infrastructure security and stability. The more ambitious an organization’s goals are, the more control it needs over its data. Standard schemas, drag and drop tools, and black box solutions are a start, but they can’t be used as competitive advantages. 

Recognizing this growing challenge, we have launched [Astronomer Enterprise Edition](https://www.astronomer.io/enterprise/), an enterprise-grade data engineering platform that allows any developer to jump directly into creating and managing data pipelines quickly and effectively. The platform includes a Heroku-like CLI capability to deploy the pipelines, as well as a New Relic-like interface to monitor and troubleshoot running pipelines. Built on leading open source tools including Kubernetes, Airflow, Prometheus, and Grafana — we have also been building and curating a [library of open-source Airflow connectors](https://github.com/airflow-plugins) for the past year.

Astronomer is dedicated to building the best platform for data engineers that allows any data pipeline to be built with collaboration, version control, and leveraging the open source community - just like all other modern software projects. 

### Deploying

Installing and deploying is easy, just follow [these docs](https://enterprise.astronomer.io/guides/google-cloud/index.html), or this video walk through:



### Try it Out

If you want to give it a test drive without deploying it to your infrastructure, you can try out [Astronomer Open](https://astronomer.io/), which provides a local version of the platform that runs on your computer via Docker Compose.


### What's Next

In addition to improvements to our Airflow module, we’re working on including a Clickstream module into Enterprise Edition very soon.


If this sounds like it’s up your alley, go straight to our [enterprise page](https://www.astronomer.io/enterprise/) or ping us directly on our webchat.
