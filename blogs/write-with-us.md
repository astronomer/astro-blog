At Astronomer, we love geeking out about things like big data trends, new tech and data engineering. This blog began as a place for every team member to share a slice of his or her expertise, but we’d like to open it up to other contributors, starting with our favorite readers.

Our best posts continue to get regularly and organically shared (even months after being posted) and our overall website traffic growth is averaging 150% per month. So this is a chance to share your original content with a growing community of like-minded folks. Also, feel free to add a 25-word bio that links to a personal or professional website.&nbsp;

### What To Write

We're interested in anything that relates to data engineering, data innovations in a particular industry, analytics and data science, data democratization, tech tutorials or similar subjects. And if you are a potential partner whose product/service might pair well with Astronomer’s platform, we’d absolutely love to hear about it ([see sample partner post here](https://www.astronomer.io/blog/6-dashboards-every-marketer-needs)). Here are some of our most popular posts:

- [Six Open Source Dashboards to Organize Your Data](https://www.astronomer.io/blog/six-open-source-dashboards)
- [5 JavaScript Tools to go from Developer to Data Scientist](https://www.astronomer.io/blog/5-javascript-tools-to-go-from-developer-to-data-scientist)
- [Airflow at Astronomer](https://www.astronomer.io/blog/airflow-at-astronomer)
- [From Superstar Culture to Moneyball: How Data is Changing the NBA](https://www.astronomer.io/blog/data-in-basketball)
- [Building an Unforgettable Product](https://www.astronomer.io/blog/building-an-unforgettable-product)

### Guidelines

- Original posts only, please. 
- Use as little or as much text as you need to explain your idea clearly.
- Visuals are encouraged!
- Thorough, research-based articles preferred.
- Posts with egregious grammatical errors will be dismissed without reading.

To maintain the integrity of the Astronomer brand, we reserve the right to only publish posts that align with our business and vision. Just keep that in mind when ideating!

### Editing

We’ll copy edit for grammar, punctuation, spelling etc. but won’t make any major changes without your knowledge. You'll be able to see all changes in a shared Google doc.&nbsp;

### Submissions

Email me at [laurel@astronomer.io](mailto:laurel@astronomer.io) and share your submission via Google doc. If you have competing ideas and want to pitch them before writing, let me know!&nbsp;

Thanks for joining with Astronomer by sharing great content with the world!
