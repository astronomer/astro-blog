# **CVG Partners with Astronomer**  

_Airport samples innovative data science with local startup_

**Erlanger, Ky. (October 17, 2016)** ― The Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport ([CVG](https://www.cvgairport.com/)) is collaborating with local tech startup, Astronomer, on a pilot program to enhance customer experience and airport operations through real-time data collection.

“Like any large company, multiple data sources present opportunities for improvement, but require staff time to analyze the data in order to act on it,” said Brian Cobb, vice president of customer experience, CVG. “That’s why we’re collaborating with Cincinnati-based startup, Astronomer, who has developed an innovative solution to stream multiple data sets into one visual reporting source. We’ll now have access to near-real time metrics that matter in one location, including security wait times, flight performance and weather. Having the data summarized on one platform will allow us to see the big picture and adjust quickly to conditions and influence outcomes to deliver results that will positively impact our customers.”

Astronomer provides automatic data integration with a large list of standard data sources and can build custom integrations upon request. The platform can be deployed on the cloud or inside a company’s VPC.

“Supporting our local international airport to become data savvy is an absolute thrill,” said Ry Walker, Astronomer Co-Founder and CEO. “The opportunity is intriguing and right in our sweet spot. CVG encouraged us to view their multiple data sources through the customers’ eyes, giving us the latitude to simplify the data science aspect into easily understood graphics despite the complexity of airport operations. With projects like this, CVG is establishing itself as an innovative leader in the transportation industry.”
