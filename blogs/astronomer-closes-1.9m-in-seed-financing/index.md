CINCINNATI--[Astronomer](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.astronomer.io&esheet=51436671&newsitemid=20161011006075&lan=en-US&anchor=Astronomer&index=1&md5=1cc516eed5214ac47590c50cfd859274), a scalable platform for enterprise-scale big data integration, has closed $1.9M in seed stage financing. [CincyTech](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fcincytechusa.com&esheet=51436671&newsitemid=20161011006075&lan=en-US&anchor=CincyTech&index=2&md5=6760a4f64ed3c34ba5abcccfb4ab03ad) led the round, with participation from west coast investors AngelPad, 500 Startups and First Ascent, and midwestern funds Connetic Ventures, Drummond Road Capital and CoreNetwork.

Big Data has never been more relevant or important to businesses, but data engineering is tedious and often impossible without the right tools. Astronomer’s cloud-based platform offers a solution. “Organizations are spending an overwhelming amount of time trying to get the right data into the right places in order to gain valuable insights,” said Ry Walker, co-founder and CEO of Astronomer. “Astronomer helps them get the data they need by connecting any data source to any database or data warehouse, securely and in real time. We enable organizations to unlock a deeper understanding of their business and leverage advanced business intelligence.”

Astronomer was founded by veteran technology entrepreneurs and employs a team of 20 in Cincinnati, Ohio. It is a graduate of AngelPad, a San Francisco-based seed stage accelerator ranked the #1 US accelerator by MIT.

“The Astronomer team has worked hard to build a product in an area of emerging complexity and need for everyone,” said CincyTech Managing Director Mike Venerable. “As data sources and uses expand exponentially in the next decade, managing the flow of data from sensors and systems to platforms that use and exploit that data will become a core element of the world. They are right in the thick of that problem and building a product built on actual customer needs, not imagined needs. It's a big challenge, big market, and a big opportunity.”

“Astronomer has the potential to be the primary data platform of the future, and the momentum in the business today is remarkable,” said Mathew Johnson, Partner at 500 Startups.

Astronomer customers include Fortune 500 companies and a growing list of enterprises including Everything But The House (EBTH), Crossroads Church, LPK and Empower MediaMarketing.

The investment allows Astronomer to continue to expand its platform and recruit locally and nationally for world-class data scientist and engineering talent.
